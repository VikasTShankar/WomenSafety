                    <li>Carry a pepper spray with you, always and keep it handy. Don’t tuck it too low in your bag. </li>
                    <li>Hold your bag as tightly as you can when you are taking public transport. You can use it to hit your predator.</li>
                    <li>When you are walking on a road, keep your mobile phone handy but avoid using it. Being on the phone makes you less alert.  </li>
                    <li>When you are travelling in an auto alone, make sure you share the auto number with someone in your family even if it’s during the day.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, if you have booked a cab, always share your coordinates with someone. </li>
                    <li>When in office, avoid going to isolated areas with no CCTV cameras. </li>
                    <li> Whenever you are posting anything on social media, make sure you don’t do it in real-time. Because if you do, you’re telling people on your social media about your whereabouts. Delay those posts by say, 20-30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you have parked your car, always look underneath, especially at night or at a less-crowded area.  </li>
                    <li>Whenever you are giving out order for delivery at a grocery store, make sure you whisper your address or write it down somewhere and give it to the shopkeeper. Never announce it. </li>
                    <li>Whenever you are getting your phone recharged, if it’s at a store, don’t loudly speak up your phone number.  </li>
                    <li>Always pour your own drinks at parties and don’t ever take drinks from complete strangers or even friends. If you’ve left your drink unattended for even a few minutes, leave it and get a fresh drink. It may have been spiked when you weren’t looking. </li>
                    <li>If you feel someone is stalking you, try to find a crowded place and call someone for help. </li>
