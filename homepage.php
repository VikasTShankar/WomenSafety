                    <li>Women’s safety involves strategies, practices and policies which aim to reduce
                        gender-based violence (or violence against women), including women’s fear
                        of crime.</li>
                    <li>Violence and discrimination can blight women’s lives and hold them back from playing a full part
                        in the workplace, society and the economy. We’re taking action to improve women’s rights and safety in the communities in which we operate.</li>
                    <li>We’re committed to respecting and promoting women’s rights, which includes the right to safety of
                        women and girls.</li>
                    <li>Women have the right to be free from violence, harassment and discrimination. Removing the
                        barriers of an unsafe environment can help women fulfil their potential as individuals and as contributors to work, communities and economies.</li>
                    <li>The World Health Organization estimates that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have
                        experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.</li>
                    <li>The importance of protecting women’s rights is recognised in the UN’s Sustainable Development 
                        Goals (SDGs), particularly those on Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).</li>
                    <li>We’re promoting safety for women in our workplaces and our extended supply chain. Our aim is to
                        implement policies and processes that women trust, with an emphasis on addressing the harmful social and cultural norms and behaviours that can leave women at risk.</li>    
                    <li>Women’s safety means a safer, healthier community for everyone. This is
                        a participatory process focused on changing community norms, patterns
                        of social interaction, values, customs and institutions in ways that will
                        significantly improve the quality of life in a community for all of its members.</li>
                    <li>Feel free to post your complaints at the Complaint Forum section.</li>
                    <li>Please do check out the safety tips.</li>
